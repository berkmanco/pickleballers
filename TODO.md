## To Do 📋

### High Priority
- [ ] players page w/ details (dont show all details in list)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] auto-login after registration (needs edge function)
- [ ] custom design for supabase auth emails (need custom SMTP server)
- [ ] UI - Add players to multiple pools (dropdown of existing players, add new, create link)

### Future / Exploration
- [ ] CourtReserve integration (scraping web, does API exist?)
  - [ ] ability to look at open courts on a date
  - [ ] ability to book a court on a date
- [ ] Venmo payment tracking (scraping web, email?)
